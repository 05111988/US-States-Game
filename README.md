# US-States-Game
This interactive game challenges users to correctly name all 50 U.S. states. Built using the Python turtle graphics module and pandas for data handling, the game displays a blank map of the United States and prompts the player to guess state names. For each correct guess, the state name is written on the map at the appropriate coordinates.
